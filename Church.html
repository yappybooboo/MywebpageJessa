            St. Michael the Archangel Parish, also known as "Laoang Church" of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Catarman was established on 1768.
            <br>
            It is located in the Municipality of Laoang, Province of Northern Samar. The Parish Fiesta is celebrated every 29th day of September
            <br>
            And also Laoang Church is the center of Catholic faith in the island of Laoang
            <br>
            Save for the bell tower, this church, especially its fa√ßade, really looked old and historical.
